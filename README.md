# Final-Year-Project
This is my implementation of credit risk assessment model which predicts whether user will be able to pay their debt on coming month with user input that was developed with the Jupyter notebook on Anaconda.

Files within the repository, the purposes they serve and the implementation techniques wherever necessary:

Logistic Regression.ipynb -> Jupyter Notebook used to train the Logistic Regression model, you may load the file to observe the training techniques implemented.
SVM.ipynb ->Jupyter Notebook used to train the Support Vector Machine model, you may load the file to observe the training techniques implemented.
GBDT.ipynb ->Jupyter Notebook used to train the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree model, you may load the file to observe the training techniques implemented.
GUI.ipynb ->Jupyter Notebook used to develop a simple GUI that implements the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree model to predict whether user will be able to pay their debt on coming month with user input, you may load the file to observe the training techniques implemented.
model1.pkl -> The pickle file of the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree model which allows us to serialize the model and store it as a binary file.
default_of_credit_card_clients.xls ->Dataset that was used to train the model. This dataset contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan 
from April 2005 to September 2005.
Final Year Project Report.pdf -> Content report on my Final Year Project (contains in-depth explanation on model training, model deployment and other features alongside justifications for techniques used).
